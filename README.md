# Investigating-Bias-in-ML-Generated-Images-Using-Stable-Diffusion-Algorithm

This project was done over 24 hours as part of the Tech+Research Track at Technica 2022. We first wanted to detect stereotypes in factors such as race and gender in ML generated images. Using a stable diffusion algorithm we were able to test many different prompts and gauge how the ML model reflects such biases through its training process.
